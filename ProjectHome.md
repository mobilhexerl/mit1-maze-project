Project 2) One after another ...

X agents have to move in a "wide" maze and have to visit all goals in a defined order. The sequence for the visits will have to be defined befor starting to move the agent. There are as many goals as angents. Agents and goals are placed arbitrarily in the beginning. Goals are not "in" walls. Agents cannot move "through" each other - they are like moving walls.

Please start with a single agent and goal and add more agents and goals later.

Solve the problem with as less moves as possible.
