/trunk

A maze with definable width, height, goals, agents and output is created.

The shortest path between is found by Dstarlite Algorithm

The shortest path to a starting goal is found for each agent

A collsion avoidance is implemented by blocking the cell for the next moving agent

A timer calculates the run-time

Several outputs are defined to show the results but can be suppressed for performance tests

Unfortunately I had to work alone so I could not implement all the features I had in mind. Nevertheless i have to admit that Dstar Lite algorithm is very fast and avoids huge memory usage.
